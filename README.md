Python homework

I am turning in this assignment late but feel it is important to catch up after the set-back with my father's passing and dealing with all the issues surrounding that. I enjoyed coming back to this and getting re-acquainted with python. This is the language I will use most frequently in the future so I need a solid foundation with this topic. 

I believe the assignment is completed exactly as the instructions and grading rubric described. All of the code runs properly, printing the results and writing a text file in the correct format.

Thank you for your patience with me. I have engaged a private tutor through Varsity Tutors and believe this one-on-one interaction will allow me to gain much better comprehension of the difficult things we are learning and better understand the "why" behind what I am doing with coding. This will be key for me. My intention is to work through all the outstanding homework assignments and get current ASAP.

Truly,
David Stagner
